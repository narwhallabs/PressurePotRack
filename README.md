# PressurePotRack
This repo contains files to create a multi-tier rack for use in 5+ gallon California Air Tools and similar pressure pots. It allows for easier entry and removal for projects, and multiple tiers to hold more projects in the pressure pot. We cut this out on a 100W CO2 laser with 6mm baltic birch plywood.
